# Pair Programming Test

We need to write methods to output a store open hours used in a sign.

## First scenario

We write a method to output a day name, its start and end times, so that the store display sign has data like:
Monday: 2:00 - 5:00
Tuesday: 3:00 - 4:00
Thursday: 2:00 - 4:00

## Second scenario

The same method should also output information for 2 consecutive days with the same times separated by a comma, like:
Monday, Tuesday: 2:00 - 5:00
Thursday: 2:00 - 4:00

## Third scenario

The same method should also output information for 3 or more consecutive days with the same time separated by a dash, like:
Monday - Wednesday: 2:00 - 5:00
Thursday: 2:00 - 4:00
